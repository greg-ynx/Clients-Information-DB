[Clients information data base]

This program take data base as inputs and convert it into a .xlsx file.
I developped it with Java programming language and designed the UI with Java swing components (Apache NetBeans IDE).
You can use any SQL query in order to get information from the table (table name is "clients").
It will then show the Table as a JTable object, when you click on a row, a new frame will open with the "client"'s informations.
